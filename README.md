# PROJECT MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD

## Project Overview

In response to an increasing demand for streamlined project oversight, this Project Management Dashboard was developed to provide data-driven insights into project performance, risk factors, and capital management. Designed for executives and project teams, the dashboard centralizes KPIs and trends, enabling timely and informed decision-making across all active projects.

  <li>Power BI Desktop (Data Visualization, Transformation, KPI Tracking)</li>
  <li>SQL (Data Verification, KPI Calculation)</li>
  <li>Excel (Initial Data Processing)
</li>
</ul>

## Power BI Techniques Learned

<ul>
  <li>Developing calculated columns and measures using DAX</li>
  <li>Data modeling to enhance relational data integrity</li>
  <li>Using bookmarks to toggle visuals and interact dynamically with the dashboard</li>
  <li>Implementing page navigation for efficient user access to various sections</li>
  <li>Applying conditional formatting to emphasize key performance areas</li>
  <li>Building dynamic titles to display relevant filtered data</li>
  <li>Setting up data validation and handling using DAX functions</li>
</ul>

## Domain Knowledge

<ul>
  <li>Project Performance Management</li>
  <li>Risk Assessment and Mitigation</li>
  <li>Capital Allocation and Investment Analysis</li>
</ul>

## Key KPIs

<ul>
  <li>Project Count</li>
  <li>Capital Invested</li>
  <li>Revenue and Profitability</li>

<ul>
  <li>CALCULATE()</li>
  <li>DIVIDE() to handle division without errors</li>
  <li>FILTER() for refining data displays</li>
  <li>SWITCH() for conditional KPI representation</li>
</ul>

## Importing Data into Power BI

To initiate the project, we import datasets generated by ChatGPT (AI) using Excel into Power BI. This process ensures that all relevant project data is accurately reflected in the dashboard. Additionally, we provide the necessary database access credentials when importing data from a MySQL database.

## Dashboard Design

Based on the requirements gathered from mock-ups, the design team crafts visuals and creates measures as necessary to present the data effectively.

## Project Portfolio

The Project Portfolio provides an overview of the overall performance of the company's projects, featuring:

### Key Metrics:

<ul>
  <li>Project Count</li>
  <li>Capital Invested</li>
  <li>Revenue</li>
  <li>Active Projects</li>
  <li>Work Hour Variance</li>
</ul>

### Visualizations:

- Cards or charts representing profit measures and project measures over the years.

### Data Table:

A comprehensive table consisting of:

| Project         | Project Owner | Status  | Priority | Capital | Hours | Profit |
|------------------|---------------|---------|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| (Example Entry) | (Owner Name)  | (Status) | (Priority) | (Amount) | (Hours) | (Profit) |
